## About Me

Welcome to My Homepage.
I'm Runlin Lei (Èõ∑Ê∂¶Êûó), a second-year Ph.D. student at Renmin University of China, advised by Prof. [Zhewei Wei](http://www.weizhewei.com). 
Before my Ph.D. journey, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, advised by Prof. Hongsong Yuan.

I like sleeping and üê∑. Both are good.
This is my GitHub homepage. Feel free to explore and learn more about me and my projects.
